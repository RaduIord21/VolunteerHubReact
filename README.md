# VolunteerHub

Welcome to **VolunteerHub**, a React-based application designed to streamline volunteer management and event planning for organizations. With VolunteerHub, you can organize volunteer activities, manage volunteer registrations, and track event progress.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the setup and installation process for running VolunteerHub locally on your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or later recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   If you haven't already, clone the VolunteerHub repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VolunteerHub.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   Change to the VolunteerHub directory.

   ```bash
   cd VolunteerHub
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required dependencies for the React application using `npm install`.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server to run VolunteerHub.

1. **Start the Development Server**
   Use the following command to start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. By default, the application runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Open in Browser**
   If the application does not automatically open in your browser, you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized assets for deployment. You can deploy this build to any static hosting service.
